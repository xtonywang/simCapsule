# simCapsule

SimCapsule is an extensible PaaS offering that supports the development, execution, and management of product design applications from anywhere in the world and on any device from high-end desktops to mobile devices. Interactive collaboration of geographically diverse development teams is facilitated by virtue of a unified environment leading to faster design-to-market product development.

SimCapsule Internal Flow can accommodate any physics-based simulation type and is demonstrated here with a three-dimensional, incompressible, Navier-Stokes solver applicable to internal flow analysis. Elements of mesh generation, boundary condition and materials specification, solver setup, and extensive results post-processing are supported which allow for streamlined analysis, faster throughput, and informed design decisions.

Interested parties are invited to explore how SimCapsule could benefit their design teams and analysis processes.
